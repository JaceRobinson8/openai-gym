# Start Day 7-31-22

Okay setup the project... Now to actually work...

Okay having issues with the renderer, I think because I am in a docker container...

Next time...

1. Go through tutorials here https://www.gymlibrary.ml/content/tutorials/
2. Do I need to fix my render problem? Probably?

Okay going through https://blog.paperspace.com/getting-started-with-openai-gym/.

# Start Day 8-4-22

Okay short programming session!

So... specifically I had a problem with the video device... ideas...

1. Just say screw it, do this outside of docker with poetry virtual env
2. figure out this video device problem in docker...

work 2 for a few minutes then say screw it... So why do I need a video device... I should just need to display a picture... Can I not display plots?

Recall it is not just plots. I am actually like rendering and possibly running games? Using pygame which uses opengl and actual game rendering services.

Okay admit defeat... Time to run without docker.

# Start Day 8-7-22

1. Fix the environment issues (done)
2. Get through the basic tutorial
3. Read the paper

### Notes on env issue

Okay due to video device problems, just bail on docker for this project? Just use poetry venv instead.

So using vscode without dev container... Don't think I have done that...

Success. Took some setup, but got iterm, oh my zsh, poetry, and now using virtual environment in vs code instead of docker.

Got the code working properly now.

But cool done for now. Next time actually go through the tutorial again.

# Start Day 8-11-22
